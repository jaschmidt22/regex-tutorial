# Regex Tutorial - Matching a Hexadecimal Value

I was given the task of creating a tutorial defining a Regular Expression. A regular expression (or regex) is a string of text that allows you to create patterns that help match, locate, and manage text. They are also frequently used to validate input. In this tutorial I will be deconstructing and defining each component of a regex that matches or validates a hexadecimal value. In CSS, a color can be specified using a hexadecimal value in the form: #rrggbb. Where rr (red), gg (green) and bb (blue) are hexadecimal values between 00 and ff (same as decimal 0-255). The following is the hexadecimal value regex that I have defined in this tutorial:

/^#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$/

The regex components I have described in this tutorial are Anchors, Quantifiers, Character Classes, Grouping and Capturing, and Bracket Expressions. After the making of this tutorial, I have a much better understanding of regular expressions. I hope the tutorial will do the same for you.

Throughout the making of this tutorial, I frequently referenced javascript.info, The full stack blog, Regexr.com, MDN Webdocs, and Google.
